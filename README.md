Interpretation of scatter plot\
The scatter plot shows that the variables Malaria Deaths and Malaria infections show close positive correlation , barring the outliers due to increased deaths in the year 2006-2009 .

Interpretation of boxplot\
Box plot shows relative incidence of deaths from Viral Hepatitis, Malaria and Japanese Encephalitis.\
Malaria\
Malaria is a relatively common illness in India with the highest number of median deaths. Overall it has a relatively short span between Q1 and Q3. Athough it may show higher variance due to the presence of some outliers.\
Viral Hepatitis\
The average deaths are relatively lower with symetric distribution on both sides. Variance is higher but data is relatively "neat" with no outliers.\
Japanese Encephalitis\
Japanese Encephalitis has a skew pointing towards a lower number of deaths although it does have a couple of outlier years having a higher number of deaths.

Interpretation of Bar plot\
Barplot shows the relative incidence of deaths from Viral Hepatitis, Malaria and Japanese Encephalitis over the years.\
As seen earlier Malaria shows a relatively higher trend, Viral Hepatitis shows a relatively stably decreasing trend, and Japanese Encephalitis shows the lowest number of deaths except in the year 2005 when it suddenly shoots up.
